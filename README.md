# tutoring-request-form

This is form that I created using streamlit, and is uploaded. It's a secondary component to another streamlit site I'm gonna make for a project. If you are to input any details, they are 
recorded in a database I created. 

My reason to use python and not traditional HTML and CSS is because I'm too lazy to code alla that. Streamlit styles for you, so yeah. 

Feel free to use code and change, I used google API.
